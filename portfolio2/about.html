        <h1>Hello Again</h1>
        <p>My name is Michael Fiore. I live in Zionsville Indiana. I've worked at Best Buy since i was 16 years old and have just now taken a break to further my studies at <a href="https://elevenfifty.org/"> Eleven Fifty Academy</a>. Before I found Eleven Fifty I had attended IUPUI studying <a href="https://soic.iupui.edu/">Informatics</a>.There I began to learn what being a computer programmer was all about. I was so excited to start learning something I figured I would love.</p>

            <p>When I got to IUPUI i quickly found it was not the right fit for me. I told my advisors that I wasn't in the right place but they manipulated me to stay. I ended up wasting a whole year of my life to learning very little. A few months out of college my family had started to see more advertising for a place called Eleven Fifty Academy. We looked them up and in less than five minutes I knew that it was where I wanted to be. At Eleven Fifty they care about the success of every person that walks through that door. They will never waste your time because everyone understands the value of it. The entire program is even designed to save you time and get out into the working force. If Eleven Fifty is not the right place for you, they are not afraid to tell you, but if they do its not empty handed. Eleven Fifty will share what your experiences and thinking style aligns with and helps you find a path to get to the next part of your life. This is a school I could get behind.</p>

            <p>I've been attending Eleven Fifty since October of 2015. Since then I've taken the Intro to Coding Class, Fundamentals to Programming, and Android 201. With the skills I've gotten there I've began working towards being an instructor at Eleven Fifty and am currently working as a student and a Teachers Assistant(TA). As a TA it has given me  the opportunity to meet so many amazing people who gave me insight to all the different ways a coder could think. Im confident that as i grow through Eleven Fifty I will become one of the best versed programmers out there and I can't wait to share everything I will learn with the world.</p>
