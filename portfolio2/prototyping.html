        <h1>My App Prototype</h1>
        <p class="lead">Persona: The people who would use my app are mainly going to be students on the IUPUI campus that want to know the schedule of the Rec center and sporting events. My friends and I are always wondering if we can go to the Natatorium to play basketball and we never know the schedule, so this app would allow people like me to know the schedule for the recreational centers around campus. I think many people could get use out of this app and would like to see it through if I ever get the chance.</p>
        
	<p class="lead">Usability and User Experience Objectives: In my prototype I mostly highlighted basic functions of my app and made an outline of my app. It is not a very complicated design, It is just a multi-paged markup of what would happen if people were to press the buttons on my app. There is a homepage that links to all of the other pages, and each page has a back button that will return the user to the homepage.</p>

        <p class="lead">Usability Test: When I gave the app test to my friends to run they did not have any problems navigating the app that I designed. Although it was not made to perform any of its functions in this stage, they said it made sense how it would work if it were a finished product. If I were going to take this app to another stage I would probably want to throw in a few more functions and enhance its design and feel to make it more professional, but the navigation that I have set up should work even with those additions.</p>
